Water resources management is threatened by climatic, economic, and political pressures, and these challenges are on particular display in Latin America and the Caribbean. 
To assess the region's ability to manage water resources, we conducted an unprecedented literature review of over 20,000 multilingual research articles using machine learning and an understanding of the socio-hydrologic landscape.
Results reveal that the region’s vulnerability to water-related stresses, and drivers such as climate change, is compounded by research blind spots in niche topics (reservoirs and risk assessment) and sub-regions (Caribbean nations), and by its reliance on an individual country (Brazil).
A regional bright spot, Brazil produces well-rounded water-related research but its regional dominance suggests that funding cuts there would impede scientifically-informed water management in the entire region.
