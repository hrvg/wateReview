corpus cleaned 17/01/2019
used hunspell american english dictionary (en_US)
ran topic model on cleaned but not lemma corpus

ran lda_model.R
k = 105
iter = 1000
alpha = 0.5
beta = 0.1
burn in = 5

R LDAvis package to visualize
can see online at ds.lib.ucdavis.edu/text-report/water-management/

note that if you want to see it locally you either need to have a web server or use firefox,
otherwise there will be a CORS error as the json data is being loaded. This can be fixed by
renaming the json file as a .js file and loading it in as a script.

run lda_model.R
then get_vocab.R
then wordfreqs.py
then createjson.R
then lda_vis.R
