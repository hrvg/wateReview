# Article Metadata

Article metadata was extracted from Elsevier API using each article's DOI.
The metadata contains the citing literature and the author-defined keywords.
The citing literature is used to build a citation network.
Keywords are used to augment the labels of country location derived from the human-reading.
This is done by looking for regular expression of the name of the 23 target countries.
