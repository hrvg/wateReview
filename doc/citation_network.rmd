# Citation Network

The citation network was extracted from article metadata which stores identifiers for the cited articles and citing article (i.e. the article to which the metadata are attached to).
A total of 29,900 citations were found between 4,603 unique articles of the English corpus.
The resulting bibliographic network is defined by its $4,603\times4,603$-adjacency matrix $B$ and is filtered to remove edges between node external to the collected corpus.
The citation network between countries, $B_C$ is obtained by:

\[ B_C = C^T \times B \times C \]

where $C$ is a $4,603\times23$-matrix containing the output of the machine learning probabilistic predictions of the location of study between $23$ possible country of study.
In consequence, $B_C$ is a weighted directed adjacency matrix.
Similar reasoning leads to the citation network between specific research topics, method topics and water budget topics by changing the matrix $C$ in the previous equation for the LDA probabilistic predictions of topics.
