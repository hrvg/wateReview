Un ejemplo de esto es el cambio clim√°tico, la contaminaci√≥n del agua, el deterioro de los ecosistemas, los cambios de uso de suelo, la p√©rdida de biodiversidad y la sobrepoblaci√≥n, entre otros y su impacto sobre la salud humana y animal. Todos estos fen√≥menos ambientales han permitido que la sociedad del siglo XXI se enfrente a los mayores retos en la historia del hombre para lograr un manejo sustentable de los recursos naturales y un desarrollo sostenible de las comunidades. En el caso particular de los recursos h√≠dricos en Latinoam√©rica, se han reportado problem√°ticas; a) falta de conciencia sobre el uso del agua, b) alteraciones a la calidad y cantidad del vital l√≠quido, c) sobreexplotaci√≥n de acu√≠feros, d) ensalitramiento de suelos y e) contaminaci√≥n de acu√≠feros, entre otros. Por todos estos antecedentes, es importante actuar en pro del cuidado de nuestro medio ambiente para asegurar una calidad de vida a la sociedad bajo un contexto social y resiliente. Como ser humano y como profesionista en el ramo ambiental me he realizado la siguiente pregunta ¬øPor qu√© si vivimos en un mundo donde el agua es la principal fuente de vida, por qu√© los seres humanos no valoramos su importancia?  Esta pregunta se hace m√°s relevante cuando se analiza que vivo y me desarrollo en un ambiente donde uno de los mayores retos es el recurso agua. El ecosistema donde me ha desarrollado se encuentra situado en el Norte de M√©xico, el cual se ha visto afectado a trav√©s del tiempo, pero en especial, en la √∫ltima d√©cada por largos periodos de sequ√≠a. Este fen√≥meno ha generado un desequilibrio en los recursos h√≠dricos del norte de M√©xico lo que ha provocado cambios negativos en los ecosistemas, as√≠ como una inminente desertificaci√≥n en la regi√≥n. Sin embargo, y a pesar que es un problema real, aun no se tiene la suficiente capacidad para conocer e implementar acciones de prevenci√≥n y/o remediaci√≥n, en su caso, para un buen manejo de este recurso natural. En lo personal, estoy consciente de que actualmente existen personas e instituciones interesadas en aportar nuevas ideas y/o alternativas para combatir el efecto de esta situaci√≥n. Por lo que es importante considerar sumar esfuerzos para incentivar a los tomadores de decisiones y la sociedad en general sobre el cuidado de este recurso natural.  ",,0,,

NGO usually take the role of research, however not always arrive to publishing in peer reviewed journals and usually limit work to technical reports.

Un ejemplo de esto es el cambio clim√°tico, la contaminaci√≥n del agua, el deterioro de los ecosistemas, los cambios de uso de suelo, la p√©rdida de biodiversidad y la sobrepoblaci√≥n, entre otros y su impacto sobre la salud humana y animal. Todos estos fen√≥menos ambientales han permitido que la sociedad del siglo XXI se enfrente a los mayores retos en la historia del hombre para lograr un manejo sustentable de los recursos naturales y un desarrollo sostenible de las comunidades. En el caso particular de los recursos h√≠dricos en Latinoam√©rica, se han reportado problem√°ticas; a) falta de conciencia sobre el uso del agua, b) alteraciones a la calidad y cantidad del vital l√≠quido, c) sobreexplotaci√≥n de acu√≠feros, d) ensalitramiento de suelos y e) contaminaci√≥n de acu√≠feros, entre otros. Por todos estos antecedentes, es importante actuar en pro del cuidado de nuestro medio ambiente para asegurar una calidad de vida a la sociedad bajo un contexto social y resiliente. Como ser humano y como profesionista en el ramo ambiental me he realizado la siguiente pregunta ¬øPor qu√© si vivimos en un mundo donde el agua es la principal fuente de vida, por qu√© los seres humanos no valoramos su importancia?  Esta pregunta se hace m√°s relevante cuando se analiza que vivo y me desarrollo en un ambiente donde uno de los mayores retos es el recurso agua. El ecosistema donde me ha desarrollado se encuentra situado en el Norte de M√©xico, el cual se ha visto afectado a trav√©s del tiempo, pero en especial, en la √∫ltima d√©cada por largos periodos de sequ√≠a. Este fen√≥meno ha generado un desequilibrio en los recursos h√≠dricos del norte de M√©xico lo que ha provocado cambios negativos en los ecosistemas, as√≠ como una inminente desertificaci√≥n en la regi√≥n. Sin embargo, y a pesar que es un problema real, aun no se tiene la suficiente capacidad para conocer e implementar acciones de prevenci√≥n y/o remediaci√≥n, en su caso, para un buen manejo de este recurso natural. En lo personal, estoy consciente de que actualmente existen personas e instituciones interesadas en aportar nuevas ideas y/o alternativas para combatir el efecto de esta situaci√≥n. Por lo que es importante considerar sumar esfuerzos para incentivar a los tomadores de decisiones y la sociedad en general sobre el cuidado de este recurso natural.  ",,0,,

A pesquisa faz parte da Tese de Doutorado em Ecologia Conserva√ß√£o e Manejo da Vida Silvestre de Evandro Lu√≠s Rodrigues que avaliou o efeito de inc√™ndios sobre a din√¢mica h√≠drica de mananciais que abastece a RMBH. O trabalho consistiu no uso do modelo hidrol√≥gico SWAT, Soil and Water Assessment Tool (que em portugu√™s significa, Ferramenta para Avalia√ß√£o de Solo e √Ågua). O modelo computacional, foi usado para investigar o efeito do fogo sobre o balan√ßo h√≠drico do Parque Estadual  da Serra  do Rola Mo√ßa - (PESRM), que recorrentemente vem sendo atingido por inc√™ndios em larga escala, que destroem sua vegeta√ß√£o. O Parque abriga v√°rias nascentes e afluentes da  bacia do Velhas e rio Paraopeba, mananciais de extrema import√¢ncia para a RMBH. Em raz√£o disso, n√≥s monitoramos dois importantes componentes do ciclo hidrol√≥gico:  Infiltra√ß√£o e vaz√£o, na √°rea desses mananciais. A  infiltra√ß√£o √© a principal porta de entrada da √°gua de chuva que flui para  o len√ßol fre√°tico  passando a  recarregar os aqu√≠feros e suas reservas subterr√¢neas e por isso mant√©m a  perenidade da vaz√£o  das nascentes. A perda da vegeta√ß√£o ocasionada pelo fogo no PESRM, prejudica a infiltra√ß√£o interferindo no ciclo natural da √°gua. Assim, para avaliar esses  e outros efeitos indesej√°veis sobre o ciclo da √°gua ,muitos pesquisadores t√™m recorrido ao uso do programa SWAT. O modelo t√™m sido largamente utilizado no mundo inteiro para prever mudan√ßas no balan√ßo h√≠drico decorrentes de diversas altera√ß√µes ou perturba√ß√µes que ocorrem no ambiente, tais como desmatamento, substitui√ß√£o de vegeta√ß√£o nativa por cultivos agr√≠colas, mudan√ßas clim√°ticas e inc√™ndios que destroem a cobertura vegetal.  Em decorr√™ncia da versatilidade e robustez das an√°lises geradas pelo SWAT n√≥s aplicamos o modelo no ambiente do PESRM, para responder se efeitos delet√©rios sobre  a capacidade  de recarga h√≠drica  com reflexos no funcionamento dos mananciais poderiam estar ocorrendo.    Quais foram as etapas? Durante que per√≠odo a pesquisa foi desenvolvida?  A pesquisa foi desenvolvida num per√≠odo de 4 anos sendo constru√≠do um banco de dados robusto contendo informa√ß√µes hidroclim√°ticas que alimentou o SWAT. A partir dele foram simulados cen√°rios prospectivos em fun√ß√£o das  incertezas sobre os recursos h√≠dricos decorrentes de inc√™ndios antropog√™nicos.  Como funcionam os modelos de computador capazes de simular essa rela√ß√£o entre a morte das √°rvores e o abastecimento h√≠drico? O sistema que equaciona o c√°lculo balan√ßo h√≠drico do SWAT, foi calibrado a partir de um longo hist√≥rico (15 anos ) do regime de pluviosidades, temperaturas, velocidade do vento, umidade e radia√ß√£o solar, todas informa√ß√µes oriundas das esta√ß√µes clim√°ticas na √°rea de influ√™ncia fornecidas pelo INPE, associadas √†s vaz√µes geradas pelos mananciais medidas pela Copasa. Essas informa√ß√µes interagem espacialmente com diferentes ‚Äúcamadas‚Äù da paisagem cujas propriedades s√£o determinadas pela cobertura vegetal, tipos de solo e topografia. A composi√ß√£o desse sistema permite  a representa√ß√£o do ciclo da √°gua mediante  o comportamento do processo natural  e  das  altera√ß√µes que possam ocorrer no meio ambiente.  Por ser georeferenciado, o SWAT ‚Äúreconhece‚Äù locais com diferentes condi√ß√µes ambientais (solos, relevo, vegeta√ß√£o e par√¢metros clim√°ticos) e portanto com diferentes capacidades de interceptar e promover infiltra√ß√£o da √°gua no solo. Tudo isso √© descrito por meio de equa√ß√µes cujos par√¢metros s√£o calibrados com base em medi√ß√µes feitas em campo e disponibilizadas num banco de dados. A partir da modula√ß√£o do sistema real, foi poss√≠vel projetar o efeito do fogo sobre o balan√ßo h√≠drico em um dos mais importantes complexos de mananciais situados na regi√£o metropolitana dentro √°rea Parque Estadual da Serra do Rola Mo√ßa e que abastece parte da RMBH. Assim, diferentes extens√µes queimadas e m√∫ltiplas coberturas vegetais, podem ser simuladas, e altera√ß√µes nas taxas de infiltra√ß√£o e escoamento superficial, s√£o calculadas determinando maior ou menor volume e/ou perenidade das nascentes. O artigo Wildfires and their impact on the water supply of a large neotropical metropolis: a simulation approach, (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969718337409) publicado no renomado Jornal  Science of the Total Environment, √© um claro reconhecimento da import√¢ncia do tema focal: sobre a perda de servi√ßos ecossist√™micos, no caso √°gua para a RMBH, devido √† queima da cobertura vegetal do PESRM.  O incremento da √°rea queimada induz perdas cumulativas resultando em m√©dia, (quando as queimadas atingem 30% da √°rea do parque), redu√ß√£o de 221 mm por ano do volume que  abastece as reservas subterr√¢neas. Durante fortes chuvas o risco de enchente cresce exponencialmente juntamente com o risco de inunda√ß√µes, e carreamento de toneladas de sedimentos que eutrofizam e contaminam os mananciais gerando d√©ficits  e perigo de escassez no per√≠odo seco.  Em continuidade a pesquisa coordenada pelos laborat√≥rios de Intera√ß√£o Animal Planta  e Ecologia de Popula√ß√µes com foco em Manejo de Recursos Vegetais, imagens da d√©cada de 1970 est√£o sendo analisadas para comparar com imagens atuais (2018) a fim de detectar transforma√ß√µes ocorridas em longo per√≠odo que a paisagem da Serra do Rola Mo√ßa conviveu com o fogo. Os resultados preliminares apontam que cerca de 42% da √°rea das matas em torno dos mananciais desapareceu desde a d√©cada de 1970, provavelmente em fun√ß√£o do fogo e desmatamentos ocasionais. As simula√ß√µes apontam que com isso o solo deixa de armazenar anualmente 18% da √°gua de chuva.  Como agravante deste panorama, dados de esta√ß√µes clim√°ticas mostram que nos √∫ltimos anos as chuvas t√™m sido menos volumosas e muitas vezes caem de forma muito intensa. E a falta da vegeta√ß√£o reduz a infiltra√ß√£o, comprometendo o abastecimento h√≠drico, e potencializa os transtornos e riscos causados por enchentes violentas.   Como a morte de √°rvores afeta o abastecimento h√≠drico?  √Årvores, arbustos e ervas amortecem o impacto da √°gua de chuva sobre o solo, aumentando a infiltra√ß√£o e reduzindo o escoamento no solo. As copas das √°rvores, posicionadas a v√°rios metros de altura, constituem a primeira barreira para interceptar a √°gua de chuva,  antes que atinja o sub-bosque; em que parte desse volume escorre pelos troncos e em sequ√™ncia atinge a superf√≠cie. No solo uma densa camada  de materiais em decomposi√ß√£o de folhas e galhos formam a serapilheira que ajuda a reduzir a velocidade do escoamento. Esse processo √© facilitado pela malha de ra√≠zes e micro ra√≠zes entrela√ßadas formando uma esp√©cie de esponja que ret√©m a √°gua no solo aumentando o tempo de perman√™ncia  da √°gua para  que infiltre, fazendo com que ela percole para as camadas mais profundas contribuindo para os aqu√≠feros. Este mecanismo garante a perenidade das nascentes alimentada pelo fluxo de base aqu√≠feros em per√≠odos de estiagem. A morte das √°rvores acarreta mudan√ßas significativas sobre o funcionamento desse elaborado mecanismo alterando o movimento da √°gua no solo de vertical (infiltra√ß√£o) para lateral (escoamento). Ao longo do tempo essa mudan√ßa acarreta perdas cumulativas na recarga dos aqu√≠feros trazendo desequil√≠brios no funcionamento hidrol√≥gico, e por consequ√™ncia coloca em risco os mananciais. Al√©m do mais, a morte das √°rvores, abre espa√ßos para esp√©cies oportunistas, plantas herb√°ceas e gram√≠neas, muitas delas invasoras, que tendem a se estabelecer e dominar o ambiente, com excelente habilidade em competir por espa√ßo, luz,  nutrientes. Essas esp√©cies apresentam r√°pido crescimento  e reprodu√ß√£o precoce, que torna a paisagem mais propensa ao fogo pelo grande ac√∫mulo de biomassa e elevada flamabilidade no  fim da esta√ß√£o seca. Portanto, a perda da cobertura arb√≥rea de matas  e cerrado  no PESRM constitui grave ruptura dos mecanismos respons√°veis pela conserva√ß√£o da √°gua na √°rea dos mananciais.  O que voc√™ v√™ como um desdobramento da pesquisa ou uma aplica√ß√£o pr√°tica dos resultados? Os resultados desta pesquisa s√£o um alerta para a valora√ß√£o dos servi√ßos ambientais oferecidos pelo complexo de mananciais da Serra do Rola Mo√ßa. A  manuten√ß√£o das disponibilidades h√≠dricas, √© essencial para o desenvolvimento econ√¥mico garantindo o acesso a √°gua das futuras gera√ß√µes. Assim, o conhecimento sobre os efeitos do fogo que impactam os mananciais h√≠dricos d√° a oportunidade √† sociedade, representada por suas autoridades, de mitigar e atuar preventivamente antes de um colapso h√≠drico, atrav√©s da conserva√ß√£o da  cobertura  que protege o sistema de mananciais. Uma das formas de preven√ß√£o seria a constru√ß√£o de aceiros para formar barreiras pr√≥ximas aos mananciais e impedir a degrada√ß√£o das √°reas de cabeceira e recarga. Outra  alternativa seria a  aplica√ß√£o de inc√™ndios em √°reas estrat√©gicas localizadas pr√≥ximas √†s matas  de galeria  (i.e. inc√™ndios planejados) para reduzir o combust√≠vel vegetal, prevenindo inc√™ndios descontrolados e de alta intensidade. Por fim, programas de educa√ß√£o ambiental e conscientiza√ß√£o das popula√ß√µes urbanas vizinhas ao PESRM e demais microbacias, precisam ser refor√ßados e disseminados de forma mais ampla e veemente, pois apenas a consci√™ncia de sua import√¢ncia ajudar√° a preserv√°-la. A facilidade da √°gua encanada nas torneiras, que brota como m√°gica em nossas casas, talvez impe√ßa ao cidad√£o comum de associ√°-la a processos ecol√≥gicos distantes, que ocorrem silenciosamente e sem cobrar nada, nas verdes serras com seus mananciais de √°guas cristalinas.
