## Challenge
Given these circumstances, it is critical to assess whether water resources research across Latin America contributes the knowledge necessary to successfully manage water.

While others did......... there are shortcomings.

To assess the state of this research, we performed an unprecedented, multi-lingual review of the state of water resources research literature in the region and across a range of topics and disciplines.
This literature review reveals bright spots and blind spots of past water research and provides insights for scientists and decision-makers to advance the relevance and impact of future scientific inquiries and to design effective policy solutions to resource management challenges.
