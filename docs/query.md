## Scopus

- allow for exporting 20k citation at once in `.csv`

### work-flow

1. perform the query
2. select years to restrict the results to under 20k entries
3. save entries as `.csv` : 
	+ on `Linux`, use `Chromium`, the export does not work with `Firefox`
	+ wait for an email with the link for downloading, this might takes 10 minutes
4. once all entries are saved, merge the `.csv` files with `./R/querying/main.R`
5. import the `.csv` to `Publish or Perish`
6. save the `.csv` into a `.ris`
7. import the `.ris` into `EndNote`
